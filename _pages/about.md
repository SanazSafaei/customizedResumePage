I'm **Sanaz**, a passionate and driven **software engineer** with strong experience in **backend development**, **distributed systems**, and **scalable architectures**. Over the past few years, I've worked on challenging projects in **e-commerce and logistics**, building reliable systems, solving complex technical issues, and improving stability through monitoring tools, test automation, and cross-team collaboration.

What excites me most is the chance to learn new **technologies, expand my skills,** and step into new environments where I can grow as both an engineer and a problem-solver. At the same time, I’m confident in the expertise I’ve built — from owning critical projects that improved system health and reduced disaster detection times from hours to minutes, to leading initiatives that influenced entire teams to adopt better engineering practices.

I thrive in dynamic, international environments where collaboration and innovation meet, and I’m motivated by the opportunity to not only deliver high-quality solutions but also inspire and support others in the process. For me, every project is a chance to push boundaries, take ownership, and contribute to building systems that make a real difference.
